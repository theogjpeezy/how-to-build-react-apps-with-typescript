import React from 'react';

/*
A front end framework focused on creating interactive user interfaces both for the web and native environments
Leverages an encapsulated component-based approach to isolate behavior and combat overly complex systems
Other frameworks, such as Vue.js or Angular tends towards MVVM or MVC architecture patterns, while React by itself doesnâ€™t push towards any one of those necessarily
Since version 16, there has been a heavy push towards functional practices, focusing mainly on Pure Functions.  
A Pure Function is a function that will always give the same output when given the same input (i.e. f(x) = x + 2)
