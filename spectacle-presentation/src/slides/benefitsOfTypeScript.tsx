//Benefits of TypeScript
/*
Types give us a way to ensure that our changes work with the application as written.  (Reduction of runtime debugging)​
Types are self-documenting reducing the amount of documentation drift.​
Types allow us to communicate intent for functionality​
Types allow us to identify regression through tooling rather than just inspection or smoke testing​
Most modern IDEs support Typescript meaning the autocompletion and warning alerts are more accurate​
Typescript is widely adopted, so most of your third-party libraries already ship with types, meaning less jumping to online docs​
At the end of the day, we still ship Javascript, so past types, there isn't anything different in the way we write the application​
Encourages ongoing refactors as a contract is established already for functionality​
