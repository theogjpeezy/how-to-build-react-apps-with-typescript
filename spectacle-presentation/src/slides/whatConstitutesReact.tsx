//What constitutes a React App
/*
A React app is simply a set of components that call one another to build a user interface
A component is either a class or a function
The push from React 16 forward has been towards functional components, so we will focus on them for this talk
A functional component is a function that takes in props and returns JSX
JSX is a syntax extension that allows html like syntax in JavaScript.  The goal is to bring the data and view together in one place.
