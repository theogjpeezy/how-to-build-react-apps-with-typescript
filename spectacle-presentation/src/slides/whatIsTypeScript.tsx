//What is TypeScript?
/*
It is a superset of Javascript​ that leverages strong types
It has a transpiler (much like babel) that will transpile your application logic into a known ES standard to ensure browser support​
It is a compiler in the idea of a type checker.  It will evaluate the types in the application and ensure everything is written to work together​
It is a way to both explicitly and implicitly describe what you are working with at any given time
